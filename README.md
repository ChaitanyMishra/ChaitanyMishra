## 🚀 About Me

I'm a self-motivated and consistent learner, currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Applications. My primary focus is on building **real-world web applications** using modern JavaScript technologies and understanding how to **deploy, scale, and maintain** them in cloud environments.

> "I believe in learning by doing — building, breaking, and improving through hands-on practice and structured growth."

## 💼 What I'm Working On

* 🌐 **SnapFetch**: A web app that lets users search high-quality images using external APIs like Unsplash and Pixabay.
* 📚 Strengthening core concepts in **JavaScript DOM, API integration**, and **clean frontend architecture**.
* ☁️ Learning to deploy apps on **Netlify, Render**, with future plans for **AWS/GCP integration**.
