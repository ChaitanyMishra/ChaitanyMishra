## üöÄ My Journey into Code

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Chaitany ‚Äî a BCA final-year student with a builder‚Äôs mindset. I learn by doing, whether it's debugging a DOM issue at 1AM or deploying a mini-project for fun. My current obsession? Becoming a job-ready full-stack developer who knows how to ship real software.

## üí° What I'm Exploring & Building Right Now

I'm currently on an exciting path to become a versatile full-stack developer, with a keen eye on how applications live and breathe in the cloud. My hands are deep in:

* **Frontend Craftsmanship**: I'm constantly honing my skills in **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** to build engaging and responsive user interfaces. I enjoy tackling **DOM manipulation** challenges and integrating with various **APIs** to bring dynamic data to life. You'll find me using modern CSS frameworks like **Tailwind CSS** to create sleek designs.
* **Stepping into the Backend**: I'm learning **Node.js** to understand server-side logic, RESTful API design, and how to connect databases like **MongoDB**.
* **Cloud Explorations**: I'm deploying projects on **Netlify** and **Render**, and will soon explore **AWS** and **GCP** for scalable infrastructure.
